#For this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone'
  
3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS Customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON Customer.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) * price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Renevue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent by those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Customer.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS Customer
ON Feb.orderid = Customer.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Feb.Quantity > 2

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Amount_Sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID) AS total_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2

10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphones'
GROUP BY product

11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(Customer.acctnum) AS Average_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS Customer
ON Feb.orderid = Customer.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).


13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
