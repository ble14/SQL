1. How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
  COUNT(orderID) = 9681

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone'
  COUNT(orderID) = 379
  
3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS Customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON Customer.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
